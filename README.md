# Three-part lecture series on statistical source separation in neuroscience

The code in this repository accompanies a module I taught in a masters-level neuroscience course in fall of 2020. The lectures were all online due to coronavirus-related restrictions. That's good for you, because now you can watch the entire lecture series!

# How to use the code

Each lecture had a "theory" session and a "Q&A/code" session. 
- The theory sessions were pre-recorded and have no associated code. You can simply watch the videos and learn.
- The Q&A/code sessions were taught live with students connecting remotely. Here you can download the code and follow along with me. However, this is not necessary --- you can also watch these videos without following along with the code.
	- In these sessions, the students text-messaged questions, comments, and discussion points, which appeared on my second monitor and were not recorded (also in the interest of preserving their anonymity). However, I read their questions and comments out loud, so you can follow along with the discussion.

# Links to the videos

The videos are on [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn0OLiymPak2PX8sAmypP1zuPmchxvz8_) on my YouTube channel. The videos are listed in chronological order. You can watch them in any order you like, but it makes sense to watch them in the order in which they appear.
